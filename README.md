# Hey there, I'm Sinjhin! 👋😈

Welcome to one doorway of my digital realm – a fusion of code, creativity, and curiosity. I'm a seasoned software engineer with a passion for AI, gaming, and all things tech.

## About Me 🌐

- 🛠️ **Senior Software Engineer**: 20+ years in the tech world, now diving deep into the realms of AI, machine learning, and platform tooling outside of client work.
- 🎮 **Gamer at Heart**: I got in trouble for tearing apart the family computer when I was 12 to add a better video card... 'nuff said?
- 🏍️ **Biker & Tinkerer**: Riding my motorcycle is my zen space and when not busy my default state is tinkering on things from electronics, to engines, to furniture and more.
- 📚 **Philosopher & Student of Life**: Always seeking new perspectives and wisdom in both the digital and physical world. Bagel and Hegel is a nice way to spend an evening.
- 🌍 **Traveler**: Experiencing new cultures, ideas, and cuisines fuels my creativity and gives me perspective. 4/7 continents so far.
- 🦸 **Wannabe Superhero**: (Or anti-hero?) Has an earnest desire to save the world ✔️
- 💻 **Polyglot Programmer**: Fluent in JavaScript/Python and rusty in most of them.
