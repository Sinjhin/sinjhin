# Hey there 👋😈

After 20+ years in tech, independently discovering (or stumbling into) genetic algorithms in high school (2005), and being absolutely fascinated by AI ever since; I'm finally taking the leap to start Ardea and build what I've always envisioned. What I believe AI should be.

Evolutionary AI that genuinely augments human capability, forms, grows, mutates, and orthogonally ideates. AI with a sensical underlying representation of the world. AI that extends rather than replaces you.

The end goal however? It's lofty. Consciousness.

About to start raising seed to make this vision real. If any of this resonates.. reach out, I'd love to connect.

## About Me 🌐

- 🧬 **CTO / AI Research Engineer**: Founder at [Ardea AI](https://ardea.io), where I am equal parts exploring evolutionary approaches to artificial consciousness and building {Augs} – ambient AI that augments rather than replaces human agency
- 💻 **Polyglot Programmer**: 20+ years of slapping keys. I'm fluent in JavaScript/Python, rusty in most of the rest
- 🎮 **Gamer at Heart**: I got in trouble for tearing apart the family computer when I was 12 to add a better video card... 'nuff said?
- 🏍️ **Biker / Builder / Tinkerer**: Riding my motorcycle is my zen space and my default state is to figure out and improve things. Whether it's code, engines, or electronics.. I'm always building something.
- 📚 **Philosopher & Student of Life**: Always seeking new perspectives and wisdom in both the digital and physical world.
- 🌍 **Traveler**: Experiencing new cultures, ideas, and cuisines fuels my creativity and gives me perspective. 4/7 continents so far.
- 🦸 **Wannabe Superhero**: (Or anti-hero?) Has an earnest desire to save the world ✔️

## What am I currently up to? 🦎

- **[Ardea AI](https://ardea.io)**: Developing NEXUS (Neural Evolution for eXtensible Universal Semantics), building out GADE (Genetic Algorithms, Directed Evolution), and tying both into {Augs}, our AI that you don't ***delegate*** to. It observes, learns, and acts. ***Extending*** what you can do
- **Research**: Orchestrated multi-tiered hierarchical evolutionary systems for artificial consciousness [Evolving Consciousness: A Journey Towards Artificial Conscious Intelligence (ACI) with Genetic Algorithms](https://medium.com/@sinjhinardea/evolving-consciousness-0ac9078f5ca8)
- **Philosophy**: Moving from multi-step prompts ("agents") to true augmentation. You don't use it, you activate it
- **Open Source**: It is a key value and I believe the way forward. Planning to release our evolutionary approach with accompanying papers: [Ardea GH](https://github.com/ArdeaAI)
